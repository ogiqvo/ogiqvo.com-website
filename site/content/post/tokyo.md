We've developed an Android app named **[Tokyo|Ogiqvo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ogiqvo.view.tokyo)**, which can REVOLVE the [Tokyo Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Station).

Trains shown in the app will follow the revolving movement of the circular scroll bar located at the bottom right. Doesn't make sense?

Actually, the circular scroll bar is showing the time inside the app. If you revolve this parameter, clock in the app will go back and forth. Because the trains are running exactly on timetable, rewinding the clock will let the trains go backwards, and fast-forwarding the clock will let the trains go forwards quickly.

Not only the experience is good, but also the train data are good. Timetable data, car counts, car sizes, and the floor maps (containing altitudes!) are **ALL BASED ON REAL FACTS**. I'm sure that this is one of the most accurate geospatial dataset of the Tokyo Station ever existing. If you have chance to travel Tokyo, come and check how accurate the data are.
